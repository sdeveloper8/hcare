        <h1>Our Care Activities</h1>
        <p>No two people are the same; each one has their own unique needs and desires, no matter how frail they are. We therefore tailor every aspect of our residents’ care to their specific needs, personality and wishes. Some people call it ‘person-centred care’.
             We understand the importance of feeling appreciated and loved, which is why we treat all of our residents as if they are one of our own family. Every member of our team is skilled, patient, compassionate and willing to go that bit further simply to reassure and make someone happy.</p>

            <p class="fadeInDown">“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
            <strong>― Albert Einstein</strong></p> 
            <p class="fadeInDown">“The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As longs as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.”
