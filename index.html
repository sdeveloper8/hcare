        <h1>Our Care</h1>
        <p>No two people are the same; each one has their own unique needs and desires, no matter how frail they are. We therefore tailor every aspect of our residents’ care to their specific needs, personality and wishes. Some people call it ‘person-centred care’.</p>
            <p>We understand the importance of feeling appreciated and loved, which is why we treat all of our residents as if they are one of our own family. Every member of our team is skilled, patient, compassionate and willing to go that bit further simply to reassure and make someone happy.</p>
